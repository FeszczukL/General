16150,"i mean, that depends on what you mean by ""this.""  insofar as oppressive gender roles go, you're correct in that it's ancient, but hte specific dynamic of men being breadwinners while women are housewives doing domestic work is actually relatively new, getting its start in the 19th century alongside industrialization.  the idea that women can't or shouldn't do hard labor would have been utterly laughable in, say, the 18th century where women obviously were doing a lot of farmwork right alongside their husbands.  and even with the industrial revolution, a lot of women did factory jobs.

the breadwinner dynamic could only have existed under a very specific set of circumstances, namely A) capitalism, because the entire concept is predicated on wage labor and not, say, a self-sufficent agrarian community where the whole community is taking care of each other and raising children communally B) very high wages that humanity hasn't really seen before or since that enable one man's income to afford a house and support not only a wife but multiple children, none of whom do wage or farm labor (though the wife would have been working her ass off maintaining that property, a lot of drug abuse happened during this period by middle class white women that just kind of doesn't ever get acknowledged).

the whole two-story house paid outright on one man's labor thing in particular came about over cold war fears of nuclear war.  suburban sprawl was seen as a way to counteract the damage a nuclear strike would do, as dense urban centers were seen as unacceptably vulnerable and would have wiped out too much of the workforce.  so that cheap housing on the outskirts of cities was kind of subsidized, with massive infrastructure projects (in parrticular highways) undertaken to enable a man's morning commute.

a lot of modern bigotries really didn't exist in their current form hundreds of years ago.  hell, in the 1400's *whitteness* didn't exist conceptually, nobody thought of themselves as white or someone else as black.  racism's a relatively recent social construct, predated by sorta similar concepts like ""foreigner"" or ""barbarian"" that missed crucial elements like heredibility (so a child born to a barbarian could be seen as fully Roman, whereas someone born to a black father would be considered black no matter what).  the world really hasn't looked much like american culture for very long, and odds are it'll radically change again.",negative

It's like someone trying to watch an anime that's supposed to be great, but there are like 300 episodes before it gets good.

Mojority of games have character customisation aka both genders 

>Fewer options for female characters. An example is the Stardew Valley game where male characters could continue playing after having an in-game baby, but female characters could not.

this is some kind of cherry picking some weird designe choices from one game. Edit: was it even a thing? I couldnt find anything about it.

>Female characters dressed in much more revealing or sexualized outfits than male characters. It's not fun to feel like a game considers you nothing more than eye candy or sex sells.

its also done to male characters just in different way as they are marketed to female audience which means egy bois, daddys, guys with 24packs on their stomach etc you can check the newest creations from league of legends or genshin impact 

>Female characters having weaker abilities or support only abilities when compared to male characters. 

nobody does that... it doesnt make sense weaker characters doesnt sell well. Supporting is not female character only thing. Not even talking about how support characters dont need to be weak by any means :V

>Consistently presenting female characters as things to be escorted, saved, or won. 

Again its not female only thing? In most games you escort help and save both male and female about ""wining"" it depends on game for example in dragon age you can ""win"" both female and male

I normally expect a *real* MMO to take **at least** ten times that much to reach maximum level, for the average casual gamer.
